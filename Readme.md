# Overview
- Created this project to see if I can create a spirograph drawer

## Goal 1: animate a rotating circle [x]

1. draw a circle
2. mark a point on it (with another circle?)
3. rotate?

- strategy is to convert distance travelled into rotations
- have to account for point of contact though


## Goal 2: parameterize the marker position [x]

## Goal 3: add path line [x]

## Goal 4: add some interesting presets, ie 5s, 7s, 6, 8, 9, 12
